# Networked-Bandits-for-Content-Optimization
Implemented a networked bandit library with two algorithms and reward models (individual engagement, influence effects) to optimize content distribution. Integrated grid search for parameter tuning, tracked cumulative rewards, and analyzed performance on both provided and custom networks, highlighting the impact of network structure.
